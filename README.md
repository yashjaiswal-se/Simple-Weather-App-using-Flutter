# Simple Weather App using Flutter

This is a simple weather application built using Flutter. It provides real-time weather updates based on the user's location, fetching data from the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/). The app features hourly weather forecasts, with a smooth horizontal scroll to display weather data for the next 6 hours.

## Features
- **Current Weather**: Displays the current weather conditions for the user's location.
- **Hourly Forecast**: Provides hourly weather forecasts for the next 6 hours, presented in a horizontal scroll view.
- **Location-based**: The app automatically fetches the user's current location using the `geolocator` package.
- **Weather Icons**: Dynamic icons are used to represent different weather conditions.
